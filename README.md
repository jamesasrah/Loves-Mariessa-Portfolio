**Portfolio Website**


This is a website I created to showcase the work of a fashion designer friend of mine.


She is very talented, and the main focus of the website is images of models in her clothes, along with a video of a fashion show she was included in at 
South by Southwest Interactive 2009.


This website is based off a customization of the [Borano Photographay HTML Template](https://themeforest.net/item/borano-photography-portfolio-template/16253679).
